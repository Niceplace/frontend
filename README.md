Web front end projects for fun

## CSSTest

This project is a basic web app generated with yeoman that uses
 * gulp
 * bower (not that necessary since I get the css/js from CDN's in the html)
 * node (v 6.x)/ npm
 * as mentioned, yeoman
 * Twitter Boostrap (3.x)
 * Jquery 3.1.1
 * Jquery-ui 1.12.1

To install the project, simply check-out the code, ensure corresponding dependencies are installed, and run `gulp serve` in the root folder (csstest) of the app.

The web page should show automatically (if not go to localhost:9000) and the aniimation should start within a few seconds
